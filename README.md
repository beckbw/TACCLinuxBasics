iPython Notebook, RStudio, and Matlab at TACC
====================================

### University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center
**October 14th, 2014, 9:00am - 12:00pm**

Python, R, and Matlab represent three of the most widely used scripting languages for life sciences research. In three separate 45 minute sessions, you will learn how to access these tools on the high performance computing resources at TACC. 

Participants must register for a TACC account before the class and bring a laptop for the hands-on exercises.
