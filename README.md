Intro to High Performance Computing for Life Sciences
=====================================================
---
### University of Texas San Antonio**October 31st, 2014, 9:00am - 12:00pm**


This class provides beginners and intermediate users with information on using resources at the Texas Advanced Computing Center and hands-on experience managing computational workflows using a Linux command line environment. The interactive lecture will emphasize common strategies used for interacting with clusters and high performance computing resources.
Participants must bring a laptop for the hands-on exercises. Instructions on creating a TACC account and installing required software will be distributed before the class to all registered participants.

**Instructors:** James Carson and John Fonner

iPython Notebook, RStudio, and Matlab at TACC
====================================

### University of Texas San Antonio**October 31st, 2014, 1:00pm - 3:00pm**

Python, R, and Matlab represent three of the most widely used scripting languages for life sciences research. In three separate 30 minute sessions, you will learn how to access these tools on the high performance computing resources at TACC. 

Participants must register for a TACC account before the class and bring a laptop for the hands-on exercises.
