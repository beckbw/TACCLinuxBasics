TACC is ending support for ~/.profile_user for bash users, and ~/.cshrc_user,
~/.login_user for csh users.

  Maverick Status: Support ended on Sept. 24, 2014.
  Stampede Status: Support for ~/.profile_user ends on or about Oct. 28, 2014.
                   Support for ~/.cshrc_user and ~/.login_user ends 
                   on or about about Dec. 9, 2014. 

We recommend you run the following command: 
 
   $ /usr/local/startup_scripts/install_default_scripts
 
This safely moves your current startup scripts into a new subdirectory named
~/.orig and installs the new startup script template files into your
home directory.  Don't forget to execute "ls -a ~/.orig" to see the contents of
the ~/.orig directory.

---------------
For Bash users:
---------------

   Please merge the contents of ~/.orig/.profile_user into ~/.bashrc.  
   Your new ~/.bashrc contains comments and instructions that will
   help you accomplish this transition. 

------------------
For C-shell users:
------------------

   Please merge the contents ~/.orig/.cshrc_user into ~/.cshrc and the
   contents of ~/.orig/.login_user into ~/.login.  There are comments 
   and instructions in both ~/.login and ~/.cshrc that will help you
   accomplish this transition.
